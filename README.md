show search results on map with markers and number list
sort by reviews&rating
autocomplete to location input 
not working: update results and map marker while user move the map(drag)

change display from horizontal to vertical layout
sorting results works and markers on map match the order
clicking a result centers the map and marker, keeping them in sync
add img using Google Places API and show in popup
if user clicks anywhere on the map, pop up closes
need to do:
popup box fix
if user drags the map, result changes as the map changes
