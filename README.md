<br>
show search results on map with markers and number list
<br>
sort by reviews&rating
<br>
autocomplete to location input 
<br>
not working: update results and map marker while user move the map(drag)


## Jun 26 2025
change display from horizontal to vertical layout
<br>
sorting results works and markers on map match the order
<br>
clicking a result centers the map and marker, keeping them in sync
<br>
add img using Google Places API and show in popup
<br>
if user clicks anywhere on the map, pop up closes
<br>
**need to do**:
popup box fix
if user drags the map, result changes as the map changes
